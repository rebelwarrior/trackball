# Logitech's Marble Mouse Configuration for Ubuntu

![image](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bq-3I9M3AFg/T1UYBbAYKrI/AAAAAAAAAXw/HGWTd_PCugc/s1600/images.jpeg)

Three configurations are provided. Uncomment the one you want. Default is my prefered configuration.

Here is my [blog](http://rabbitmoondot.blogspot.com/2011/10/setting-up-marble-mouse-for-ubuntu.html) entry on how I did this.

**Usage:**

After selecting and uncommenting the configuration wanted. Run this command:

    $ruby trackball.rb

If the script finds a Marble Mouse config file present it will ask to overwrite this file interactively.
